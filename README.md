# Landuse_Calculations

Purpose: To develop landuse datasets from ABAG Projections that can be used in VTA and CCAG Models.

This is python code that incorporates pandas to do the calculations.

Consider to use the "requirements.txt" file to get the right version of pandas to work with this code.

1.  Use ```exp_growth_calculator_for_inputs.ipynb``` to generate intermediate MTC calculations files in the ABAG_03202018\ folder.
1.  Use ```TAZ_Calcs.ipynb``` to generate the distributed calculation files for CCAG as well as BART.
